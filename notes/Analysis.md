# Questions for Roshan
* When were phenotypes collected compared to when we collected pods?
    * what are the differences in experimental conditions bt agronomic and seedpod traits?

# Features to Add
1. Morphometrics:
    1. Absolute
        * wing area
        * env area
        * seed area
        * wing perimeter (`wing+env+seed` first)
        * env perimeter (`env+seed` first)
        * seed perimeter
    2. Relative
        * wing-to-(wing+env+seed) (Area) 
        * env-to-... (Area)
        * seed-to-... (Area)
        * env-to-wing (Perimeter)
        * seed-to-wing (Perimeter)
2. color-based traits **Done**
    * wing_rgb_r, wing_rgb_g, ... , wing_lab_B
    * env...
    * seed...
3. 

# Other Additions
* Put phenotypes into vanilla decision tree, other simple models to see what's predictive of yield
